Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:


```python
a=10
b=20
a+b-5
```




    25




```python
a=10
b=20
a%5
```




    0




```python
#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```




    17




```python
#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
min=200
min/60
```
